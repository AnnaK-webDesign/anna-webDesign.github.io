<h1>Memories</h1>
<p>Memories are <em>special</em>.</p>
<p>They are moments when you feel <em>happiest</em>,</p>
<p>But also when you feel <em>downhearted</em>.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Some</strong> may be long-lasting,</p>
<p>While others are <em>forgetful</em>.</p>
<br>
<p>They come as they go,</p>
<p>But we always <strong>create</strong> more.</p>
<br>
<p>When we look back at them,</p>
<p>We always have <strong><em>emotions</em></strong> we feel in these created memories.</p>
<br>
<p>This is what makes mamories hold a special place in our <em>mind</em>and <em>heart</em>.</p>
<p>It is the <strong>feeling</strong> we experience during these moments.</p>
